<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>The Insider Trading Fund resembles a pyramid structure, starting with a single point on top, that becomes progressively wider toward the bottom. Early investors bring in more potential investors and the investment pool grows over time. Throughout the growth of the investment pool, high dividends are paid out to the shareholders, prioritizing those who referred the greatest new investors. Since the investment pool continuously grows, money is continuously made. </p>
